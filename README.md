# TimeTravel
This is a fun, short Ruby program for calculating which day of the week and day-month-year it would be after X number of days (is) are added to today.

To use, enter any number of days into the instantiated module::class (Line 48). Remove the 7000 - it is merely a placeholder - and enter your own.  If you are counting into the future, your value would be positive. If you are trying to count into the past, the value would be prepended with a negative ( - ) sign. 

More classes and methods are planned to be added in the future to possibly expand the program.
